        <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies Research</h2>
    <p>The website I chose to explore is <a href="https://explore.ownprimland.com/">Primland Luxury Blue Ridge Mountain Resort</a> and I found it through the Awwwards website. I was first genuinely blown away by how visually stunning this website was, but as I started using it I found it was also just plain fun. The website is an interactive map of a mountain resort, and I’m not too sure if they use a satellite photo or a 3D model (for the sake of this assignment lets say it’s satellite imagery) but it is such a beautiful and clever way to integrate map/terrain imagery in a way that’s just so immersive. Since the imagery spans the web page view and beyond, it gives the user a task of discovering different parts of it which is super cool.

        <h2>Overuse of Overlays: Thoughts and Opinions</h2>
    <p>The first thing I noticed about <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/">this article</a> is that it was written in 2015, which is now over 10 years ago. I admittedly went into reading this article a little wary of how relevant the information would be, considering how much UX/UI is constantly evolving in the digital landscape today, but I found that it mainly discussed the topic of overlays from a basic foundational level.<br>

    I appreciated that the article started with discussing a brief background of what overlays are. I think it's always really helpful learning about the original intention behind UI elements, so that we can keep that in mind when using them now.<br>

    For a similar reason, I also liked reading the “Considerations When Using Overlays” section because it explains the reasoning behind the simple logical standards when using overlays. This section also mentioned that it is helpful to make content accessible to keyboard users by allowing the escape key to close the overlay, which we talked about on class on Tuesday. <br>

        <h2>Best Practice For Form Design</h2>
    <p>As someone interested in UX/UI design, I will admit I have never really given form design much of a thought before reading <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">this article</a>. I found the information in the article quite insightful and good to keep in mind when planning my madlibs composition.<br>

    Firstly, I found the bar graph statistics on “reasons for abandonment during checkout” to be super interesting. I like that it visualized a lot of subconscious thoughts that I personally have had when choosing to abandon the checkout page. I also like that the writer was able to frame the information from the bar graph and apply it to form design in general. The tip I found most helpful was using an asterisk to indicate which information is required versus optional. I realized I often skim over forms to immediately find the boxes with asterisks to make the form completion process faster.<br>

    <a href="https://purchase.mondaviarts.org/myaccount">The Mondavi Arts new account registration page</a> is a good example of a one-column layout, effective label positioning, and distinguishing optional and required fields. <br>
