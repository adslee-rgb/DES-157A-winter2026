        <h2>Best Practice For Form Design</h2>
    <p>As someone interested in UX/UI design, I will admit I have never really given form design much of a thought before reading <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">this article</a>. I found the information in the article quite insightful and good to keep in mind when planning my madlibs composition.<br>

    Firstly, I found the bar graph statistics on “reasons for abandonment during checkout” to be super interesting. I like that it visualized a lot of subconscious thoughts that I personally have had when choosing to abandon the checkout page. I also like that the writer was able to frame the information from the bar graph and apply it to form design in general. The tip I found most helpful was using an asterisk to indicate which information is required versus optional. I realized I often skim over forms to immediately find the boxes with asterisks to make the form completion process faster.<br>

    <a href="https://purchase.mondaviarts.org/myaccount">The Mondavi Arts new account registration page</a> is a good example of a one-column layout, effective label positioning, and distinguishing optional and required fields. <br>
